# Layers of Ash: An Interactive Wildfire Experience

## Overview
**Layers of Ash: An Interactive Wildfire Experience** is an interactive and educational art installation that visualizes the causes, impacts, and dynamics of wildfires. By combining a layered physical model with data analysis and storytelling, the project aims to raise awareness of wildfire risks. The installation integrates:

- Transparent acrylic boards displaying environmental factors.
- A topographic map designed as a puzzle for audience interaction.
- Dynamic LED lights to simulate fire spread.
- Audio explanations and real-world data driving the visualization.

This project merges art, technology, and environmental education into a compelling interactive experience.

## Why
At its core, the project uses a layered design to represent the interconnected factors driving wildfire behavior, such as:

- Vegetation
- Humidity
- Wind patterns

By engaging audiences with interactive elements like removable puzzle pieces, dynamic LED lights, and audio narration, the installation transforms abstract data into an accessible and tangible experience.

The significance of this project lies in its ability to merge art and science, creating a space where audiences can explore critical environmental issues in an engaging and thought-provoking way. Wildfires are a growing global concern, particularly in regions like Southern California. By visualizing the factors contributing to wildfire risks, **Layers of Ash** not only educates but also fosters a deeper connection to the environment and highlights the importance of preventative action.
