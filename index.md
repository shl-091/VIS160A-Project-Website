**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
Where in each of SDGE's circuits could a new switch be installed so as to maximize the reduction of the expected annual rate of customer shut-offs?

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
Community Resilience and Patient-Centric Web/App with Real-Time PSPS Heatmap

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
I learned how to use geo spatial analysis, which I didn't know before.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
After getting the result form the data analysis, I want to turn them into practical applications. So I'd like to learn how to build an APP.
